<h3>2. Tokenization</h3>
Tokenization is the process of sending sensitive data via an API call or batch file to a tokenization provider that then replaces that data with nonsensitive placeholders called tokens. It can be used to secure and desensitize data by replacing the original data with an unrelated value of the same length and format. The tokens—which, in the interest of maintaining business utility, can retain elements of the original data—are then sent to an organization’s internal systems for use, and the original data is stored in a secure token vault.
